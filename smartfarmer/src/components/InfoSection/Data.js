    "This research presents a smart farming system designed for home farmers to identify deficiencies, pests and weeds in their crops. The proposed system employs deep learning and image processing techniques to analyze images captured using a mobile phone camera. The system comprises four components, each responsible for identifying a specific type of damage. The isolated component is then analyzed using a deep learning model to determine the type of damage and provide remedial actions. The proposed system has the potential to improve crop health, increase yield, and reduce costs associated with ineffective remedial actions. The results of our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system in identifying and diagnosing crop damage",

    "With Sri Lanka currently grappling with economic and food crises, the agriculture sector has emerged as a prominent industry. A notable trend has emerged where a significant portion of the population has turned to cultivating their own food. However, newcomers to this field often encounter a range of challenges. In light of these circumstances, the primary objective of this research is to identify and propose improved solutions for the issues faced by individuals starting out in agriculture. By addressing these concerns, we aim to contribute to the development of a more sustainable and resilient agricultural system in Sri Lanka.",

    "In today's rapidly advancing technological landscape, there is a growing need for intelligent systems that can assist individuals in navigating through challenging environments, while also facilitating socialization and object recognition. This research problem aims to address the following key challenges: (1) navigating through known unknown obstacles, (2) incorporating facial age, gender, and emotion detection for socialization purposes, (3) identifying staircases and assisting individuals to reach their destinations, and (4) recognizing and interpreting various objects, such as handwritten papers, advertising boards, logos, and cash notes.",
